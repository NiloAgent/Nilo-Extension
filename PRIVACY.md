# Privacy Policy for Nilo - Solana Token Security Analyzer

**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Overview

Nilo - Solana Token Security Analyzer ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data Collected Locally
- **Token Analysis Results**: Analysis results are cached locally in your browser for 5 minutes to improve performance
- **User Preferences**: Settings and preferences are stored locally in Chrome's storage
- **GitHub Token** (Optional): If you provide a GitHub API token for enhanced analysis, it is stored locally in your browser

### Data Sent to Third-Party APIs
When you analyze a token, the extension sends the following data to external services:
- **Solana Token Address**: Sent to Bitquery API and Solana RPC endpoints for blockchain data analysis
- **GitHub Repository URLs**: If you use the GitHub analysis feature, repository URLs are sent to GitHub's public API

## How We Use Information

- **Token Analysis**: Blockchain addresses are used to fetch public blockchain data for security analysis
- **Caching**: Analysis results are temporarily stored locally to avoid repeated API calls
- **GitHub Analysis**: Repository information is used to assess project legitimacy and development activity

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer your personal information to third parties. However:
- Token addresses are sent to public blockchain APIs (Bitquery, Solana RPC) for analysis
- GitHub URLs are sent to GitHub's public API for repository analysis
- All API communications use HTTPS encryption

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage Only**: All user data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- **No Remote Servers**: We do not operate servers that store your personal information
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Cached analysis results are automatically cleared after 5 minutes

## Third-Party Services

The extension uses these third-party services:
- **Bitquery API**: For Solana blockchain data analysis
- **Solana RPC Endpoints**: For token metadata and blockchain information
- **GitHub API**: For repository analysis (optional feature)

Each service has its own privacy policy and terms of service.

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Clear Data**: Clear all locally stored data by removing the extension
- **Disable Features**: Choose not to use optional features like GitHub analysis
- **Review Data**: All stored data is accessible through Chrome's developer tools

## Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use encrypted HTTPS connections
- **No Sensitive Data**: We do not collect passwords, private keys, or other sensitive information
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored locally in your browser, not on external servers

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
