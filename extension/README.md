### Common Issues

**"Invalid Solana mint address format"**
- Ensure address is 32-44 base58 characters
- Don't use Ethereum addresses (starting with 0x)
- Don't use .sol domain names

**"Analysis failed. Please try again."**
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few seconds (API rate limiting)
- Verify the token address exists on Solana

**"No token metadata found"**
- Token may be very new or have incomplete metadata
- This is a risk factor but doesn't mean the token is invalid
